External dependencies must be avoided as much as possible.
If not asked, do not document your changes in md files. And keep commentaries in the code to a minimum, they should be obvious.
Try to factorize your code as much as possible (but keep it consistent), and avoid code duplication. Use the existing widgets/components when possible.
